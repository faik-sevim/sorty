# Sorty

> Sorty is a fun puzzle game that challenges you to sort a set of numbers by moving them up, down, left, or right. The main objective of the game is to sort the numbers using only four different moves and with the least number of moves possible. When you slide a block to the right, it will move to the top; sliding it to the left will move it to the bottom. You can also swipe the neighbor blocks. Things are becoming more complex on higher levels :)

This game was fully developed by help of Chat Gpt4. I had no prior experience in mobile game development, but with the help of Chat Gpt4, I was able to create a game using Unity from start to finish. I plan to share this game on the market in the near future.
